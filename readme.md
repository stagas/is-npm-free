# is-npm-free

```sh
npm i -g is-npm-free

# quickly check
is-npm-free my-package-name

# gets the latest names list to check against
is-npm-free my-package-name --refresh
```

The cli will exit with an error code if the name isn't free so it can be used in scripts.

Credits go to https://github.com/bconnorwhite/is-name-taken as this only packages that module as a simple cli.
